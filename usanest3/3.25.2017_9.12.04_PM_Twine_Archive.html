Digital Humanities, Feminism, and Diversity&#x27;&#x27;
 
This course will examine the relatively new field of [[digital humanities]] and the way its formation is being shaped in relation to [[gender]] and other related aspects of [[cultural diversity]] such as [[race]], [[sexuality]], and [[indigeneity]]. 

It will consider tensions between [[methodology and content]], the debate over [[theory]] in relation to digital humanities, and [[the politics of self-definition]] in relation to professional and intellectual self-positioning. We will consider some of the ways in which gender has been mobilized as a concept within digital humanities debates and practices within a range of contexts, considering particular areas of controversy within and at the edges of the field including the question of how to encode sex within the Text Encoding Initiative, the approaches taken by a range of feminist projects in the field, text mining and stylistic analyses related to gender, the politics of tools and algorithms, community engagement and intimate publics, and debates over gender and games, including the Gamergate controversy. 

Within these contexts, we will seek to understand [[how gender intersects]] with other identity categories including race, sexuality, class, and geography in the production and consumption of networked knowledge.

Some, such as the editors of the //Companion to Digital Humanities// volumes published by Blackwell ([[Schreibman et al|Works Cited]]), consider digital humanities to be an emergent discipline. Others, including myself, see it is an interdisciplinary field of research and teaching that is distinguished by the way it [[thinks through digital tools and methods|Thinking through digital tools and methods]] to approach questions in the humanities.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="gender" tags="" position="875,775">Performative.

The study of gender emerges from the field of [[women&#x27;s studies or feminist studies, now often called gender studies|feminism]], and often coupled with sexuality. 

Of course one has to take into account [[class]], [[sexuality]], [[indigeneity]] and other intersecting components of social subjectivities.

OF all the theories current concerning women, none is more curious than the theory that it is needful to make a theory about them. That a woman is a Domestic, a Social, or a Political creature; that she is a Goddess, or a Doll; the &quot;Angel in the House,&quot; or a Drudge, with the suckling of fools and chronicling of small beer for her sole privileges; that she has, at all events, a &quot;Mission,&quot; or a &quot;Sphere,&quot; or a &quot;Kingdom,&quot; of some sort or other, if we could be agree on what it is,--all this is taken for granted. But, as nobody ever yet sat down and constructed analogous hypotheses about the other half of the human race, we are driven to conclude, both that a woman is a more mysterious creature than a man, and also that it is the general impression that she is made of some more plastic material, which can be advantageously manipulated to fit our theory about her nature and office, whenever we have come to a conclusion as to what that nature and office may be. &quot;Let us fix our own Ideal in the first place,&quot; seems to be the popular notion, &quot;and then the real Woman in accordance thereto will appear in due course of time. We have nothing to do but to make round holes, and women will grow round to fill them; or square holes, and they will become square. Men grow like trees, and the most we can do is to lop or clip them. But women run in moulds, like candles, and we can make them long-threes or short-sixes, whichever we please.&quot;
